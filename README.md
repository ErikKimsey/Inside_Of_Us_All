##### (Wordy, highly speculative) Artist Statement:
Inside of all are layers of an individual, unique psyche and personal history.  These layers are who were, comprise our makeup.
What I see as unfortunate, is that it is apparent that these layers are intentionally hidden and private.  Hidden from expression
 to project whatever an individual perceives, writ large, as normalcy.  
 
 For decades (if not centuries), philosophers, historians, sociologists, and scientists have deconstructed the 
 notion of normalcy.  Normalcy, while historically important for the thriving and solidarity of small communities, has since been 
 transformed into ideology architected by institutions.  Specifically, and most importantly, capitalist institutions.
 
 ###### Mind you, "Inside Of Us All" is not an anti-capitalist statement.  
 
 "Inside Of Us All" (or, "We Want To Know; We Don't Want To Know") is about the stepping outside of the safety of normalcy for individual authenticity.  
 Allowing evidence-based, and even theoretical, knowledge of the individual to embrace otherwise hidden layers of the self to come forth.
 
Opening broad acceptance to individuality and "difference" has been argued as an answer to strengthening economies, 
 (via increasing work performance and increasing creative problem solving) and mental and physical health.  
 
TL;DR
"Inside Of Us All" (or, "We Want To Know; We Don't Want To Know") is about dissolving notions of normalcy as an effort to streamline economic development 
and welfare worldwide.
